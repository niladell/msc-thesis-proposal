abstract = {We have developed a deep generative model, generative tenso-rial reinforcement learning (GENTRL), for de novo small-molecule design. GENTRL optimizes synthetic feasibility, novelty, and biological activity. We used GENTRL to discover potent inhibitors of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a kinase target implicated in fibrosis and other diseases, in 21 days. Four compounds were active in biochemical assays, and two were validated in cell-based assays. One lead candidate was tested and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics in mice. Drug discovery is resource intensive, and involves typical time-lines of 10-20 years and costs that range from US{\$}0.5 billion to US{\$}2.6 billion 1,2. Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate this process and reduce costs by facilitating the rapid identification of compounds 3,4. Deep generative models are machine learning techniques that use neural networks to produce new data objects. These techniques can generate objects with certain properties, such as activity against a given target, that make them well suited for the discovery of drug candidates. However, few examples of generative drug design have achieved experimental validation involving synthesis of novel compounds for in vitro and in vivo investigation 5-16. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a collagen-activated pro-inflammatory receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in epithelial cells and involved in fibrosis 17. However, it is not clear whether DDR1 directly regulates fibrotic processes, such as myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition, or earlier inflammatory events that are associated with reduced macrophage infiltration. Since 2013, at least eight chemotypes have been published as selective DDR1 (or DDR1 and DDR2) small-molecule inhibitors (Supplementary Table 1). Recently, a series of highly selective, spiro-indoline-based DDR1 inhibitors were shown to have potential therapeutic efficacy against renal fibrosis in a Col4a3-/-mice model of Alport syndrome 18. A wider diversity of DDR1 inhibitors would therefore enable further basic understanding and therapeutic intervention. We developed generative tensorial reinforcement learning (GENTRL), a machine learning approach for de novo drug design. GENTRL prioritizes the synthetic feasibility of a compound, its effectiveness against a given biological target, and how distinct it is from other molecules in the literature and patent space. In this work, GENTRL was used to rapidly design novel compounds that are active against DDR1 kinase. Six of these compounds, each complying with Lipinski's rules 1 , were designed, synthesized, and experimentally tested in 46 days, which demonstrates the potential of this approach to provide rapid and effective molecular design (Fig. 1a). To create GENTRL, we combined reinforcement learning, varia-tional inference, and tensor decompositions into a generative two-step machine learning algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 1) 19. First, we learned a mapping of chemical space, a set of discrete molecular graphs, to a continuous space of 50 dimensions. We parameterized the structure of the learned manifold in the tensor train format to use partially known properties. Our auto-encoder-based model compresses the space of structures onto a distribution that parameterizes the latent space in a high-dimensional lattice with an exponentially large number of multidimensional Gaussians in its nodes. This parameter-ization ties latent codes and properties, and works with missing values without their explicit input. In the second step, we explored this space with reinforcement learning to discover new compounds. GENTRL uses three distinct self-organizing maps (SOMs) as reward functions: the trending SOM, the general kinase SOM, and the specific kinase SOM. The trending SOM is a Kohonen-based reward function that scores compound novelty using the application priority date of structures that have been disclosed in patents. Neurons that are abundantly populated with novel chemical entities reward the generative model. The general kinase SOM is a Kohonen map that distinguishes kinase inhibitors from other classes of molecules. The specific kinase SOM isolates DDR1 inhibitors from the total pool of kinase-targeted molecules. GENTRL prioritizes the structures it generates by using these three SOMs in sequence. We used six data sets to build the model: (1) a large set of molecules derived from a ZINC data set, (2) known DDR1 kinase inhibi-tors, (3) common kinase inhibitors (positive set), (4) molecules that act on non-kinase targets (negative set), (5) patent data for biologically active molecules that have been claimed by pharmaceutical companies, and (6) three-dimensional (3D) structures for DDR1 inhibitors (Supplementary Table 1). Data sets were preprocessed to exclude gross outliers and to reduce the number of compounds that contained similar structures (see Methods). We started to train GENTRL (pretraining) on a filtered ZINC database (data set 1, described earlier), and then continued training using the DDR1 and common kinase inhibitors (data set 2 and data set 3). We then launched the reinforcement learning stage with the reward described earlier. We obtained an initial output of 30,000 structures (Supplementary Data Set), which were then},

abstract = {Over the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various artificial intelligence research areas. Evolved from the previous research on artificial neural networks, this technology has shown superior performance to other machine learning algorithms in areas such as image and voice recognition, natural language processing, among others. The first wave of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in recent years, and its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. Examples will be discussed covering bioactivity prediction, de novo molecular design, synthesis prediction and biological image analysis.},
