abstract = {With the advent of deep generative models in computational chemistry, in silico anticancer drug design has undergone an unprecedented transformation. While state-of-the-art deep learning approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they disregard the genetic profile and properties of the target disease. Here, we introduce the first generative model capable of tailoring anticancer compounds for a specific biomolecular profile. Using a RL framework, the transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells are used as a context for the generation of candidate molecules. Our molecule generator combines two separately pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) - the first VAE encodes transcriptomic profiles into a smooth, latent space which in turn is used to condition a second VAE to generate novel molecular structures on the given transcriptomic profile. The generative process is optimized through PaccMann, a previously developed drug sensitivity prediction model to obtain effective anticancer compounds for the given context (i.e., transcriptomic profile). We demonstrate how the molecule generation can be biased towards compounds with high predicted inhibitory effect against individual cell lines or specific cancer sites. We verify our approach by investigating candidate drugs generated against specific cancer types and find the highest structural similarity to existing compounds with known efficacy against these cancer types. We envision our approach to transform in silico anticancer drug design by leveraging the biomolecular characteristics of the disease in order to increase success rates in lead compound discovery.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various domains over the past decade, its application in molecular informatics and drug discovery is still limited. Recent advances in adapting deep architectures to structured data have opened a new paradigm for pharmaceutical research. In this survey, we provide a systematic review on the emerging field of graph convolutional networks and their applications in drug discovery and molecular informatics. Typically we are interested in why and how graph convolution networks can help in drug-related tasks. We elaborate the existing applications through four perspectives: molecular property and activity prediction, interaction prediction, synthesis prediction and de novo drug design. We brief ly introduce the theoretical foundations behind graph convolutional networks and illustrate various architectures based on different formulations. Then we summarize the representative applications in drug-related problems. We also discuss the current challenges and future possibilities of applying graph convolutional networks to drug discovery.},

abstract = {We have developed a deep generative model, generative tensorial reinforcement learning (GENTRL), for de novo small-molecule design. GENTRL optimizes synthetic feasibility, novelty, and biological activity. We used GENTRL to discover potent inhibitors of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a kinase target implicated in fibrosis and other diseases, in 21 days. Four compounds were active in biochemical assays, and two were validated in cell-based assays. One lead candidate was tested and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics in mice.},
