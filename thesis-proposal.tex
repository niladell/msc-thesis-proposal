    \section*{Introduction/Background}  

Drug discovery—the process by which a potential new medicine is identified---is a
 complex process that encompases the intersection of several fields (such as biology,
 statistics, chemistry or pharmacology). The entire process is a long and costly
 endeavour, with a typical time-frame of 10 to 20 years till maket release and an
 estimated cost between 2 and 3 billion USD \cite{Schneider2019, Scannell2012}. With
 just a small quantity of the initially identified compounds actually becoming an
 approved medicine. Many of these dropouts happening at the early stages of the entire
 pipeline.

It exists, then, a need for better mechanisms for detecting better candidates. One of
 the most promising directions is to improve the \emph{in-silico}
 methods---computational simulations are relatively cheap and quick run that makes them
 an interesting solution. \emph{In-silico} simulations then cover two main aspects:
 \textbf{predictive modelling}, meaning modelling the dynamics of the human body---such
 that any effect relevant to the durg or the disease will be captured by it---and
 \textbf{generative modelling}, i.e. methods to generate good candidates which, in part,
 means methods that are effective at exploring the vast space of possible compounds,
 estimated to be on the order of $10^{60}$\cite{Reymond2012}.


% To do so, two main components are required: a model accurate enough of the human body,
% such that it reflects reality properly; a way to generate good candidates that is
% effective at exploring the vast space of possible compounds.

% Those two components may be subdivided into smaller parts and abstracted in order to
% account for different elements, for example, one may only look at ic50 as a metric for
% drug response or one may try to generate new compounds by exploring compounds
% chemically similar to already in use drugs. At the same time, many different methods
% may be used to tackle all these questions.


Among the different computational approaches that have been used in the process of drug
 discovery deep learning (DL) has shown signs to be a potential game changer
 \cite{Dargan2019}. DL has been able to capitalize on the exponential growth of data and
 the higher availability of computational resources. For examle, DL has had a remarkable
 success on computer vision (CV) \cite{CV} and natural language processing (NLP)
 \cite{NLP}, and has become the go-to solution for any problem in these two fields. It
 is, at the same time, penetrating into other fields, drug-discovery being one of them
 \cite{Chen2018}. 

When we deal with this biological and molecular data, it exists a challenge on how to
 deal with the intrinsic structure of the data.
%  When it comes to the methodology it exists an orthogonal problem [regarding
%  strcutured data] when we deal with biological data.
 If we look at the case of deep learning for CV, where we deal with images, a key
 element of any architecture for it's success was the use of convolutional layers---one
 will mostly observe convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when analizying the state of
 the art in CV---which introduce a structural a prior based on the structure of the
 data\cite{CNNs}. A similar case can be made for NLP\cite{Somethings?}. For that reason,
 there exists a strong signal to look for models that can leverage the structural
 equivalent when in molecule or protein data, i.e. leverage graph structures. On that
 direction there has been a rising field on the use of Graph Convolutional Neural
 Networks (GCNNs)\cite{Wu2019}, and in fact, there have been several models as such
 being proposed in the drug design literature \cite{Sun2019}. [NOTE: Rewrite this last
 section]
 %Sign of that is the recent advancements in that direction \cite{Sun2019}.
 % [There is already a literature on this and I'm gonna talk about it \cite{Sun2019}]

Another of the big challenges is to unify all the aspects of drug-discovery and be able
 to incorporate all the rellevant biological information when designing possible
 candidate molecules. An initial success story on that line is a recently paper
 \cite{Zhavoronkov2019} where the authors describe a deep learning method by which they
 are able to discover, synthetise, and test in an animal model, inhibitors of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1)—a kinase
 implicated in fibrosis—in just 21 days.

Those promising results, albeit encouraging, are just the tip of the iceberg. There is
still a long way till a model can satisfactorily capture the biological complexity of
any arbitrary target and produce promising candidates. On top of that, there is an added
dimension, as such model should account for the variability from patient to patient and
be able to generate a molecule that accomodates for all the genotipic and phenotipic
variants, or generate different candidates for each of the genetic populations of
interest. [need a ref here]

[I am not completely sure about this paragraph but I leave it here so I don't forget for
now] Even more, in the case of diseases like cancer, an heterogeneous population may
appear within a single patient. So the same variant effects arise inside a dynamic
ecosystem, where a drug that just targets a subpopulation may lead to an evolutionary
pressure complicating further the treatment outlook [reference paper of evolutionary
perspective to cancer].

There is then a great need to develop models that can be conditioned based on a large
set of biological [conditions?] and meaningfully account for this variations when
generating a compound or/and evaluating a compunds effect when administered.

Last of all, in a more holistic view, it is of interest to develop multi-scale models
that capture system complexity at the different levels. For instance, a model that is
able to learn protein-compound interactions---commonly known as the docking
problem---while at the same time use this information to predict effects of the
introduction of the compound on the larger protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.
[ref? \cite{Sun2019}]

    \section*{Aim \& Methods}
[Should I separate em in two different sections?]

The aim of this thesis will be two fold. One the one side, analyze how the explicit use
of GCNNs may open new oportunities when dealing with biological and checmical data. On
the other side, explore how modelling the biology at different levels (e.g. molecular
structure v.s. molecular interacton network) may help with our understanding [of the
biology? of compounds interaction?] and create better models. Furthermore, evaluate how
these different scales may be integrated toguether.

This precise work will be focused around exploring all these concepts in the context of
designing anti-cancer drugs. The work will be done in colaboration with the
Computational Systems Biology group at IBM Research (Zurich). The group is currently
focused on individualised paediatric cure (iPC), so an end goal of this project is for
the end results of it to help in that effort, for instance in contibuting to the ongoing
research in neuroblastoma.

As mentioned previously, the idea of using GCNNs for drug discovery is not a new one in
the literature \cite{Sun2019}. My project will build upon those ideas presented in the
literature, expand them and test their feasibility by implementing them into a wider
framework for drug design \cite{Born2019}. In that context two main areas of application
appear. One of them would be to re-desing the generative model, for instance by
reframing the vairational autoencoders, used for molecule generation, to architectures
that operate over graphs \cite{Simonovsky2018,Li2018,Li2018a}. The second area would be
to find better ways to asses the activity of these molecules, and in a wider context,
assess their relevance as drug candidates, i.e. improve the predictive model. In the
concrete case of the mentioned framework it is done by using a critic network
\cite{Manica2019}. This could be expanded on a set of different fronts: usign structural
data instead of SMILES \cite{Li,Do2019}, by using GCNNs to cover a much wider network of
genes \cite{Oskooei2019, Wang2019}, or by introducing particular scores (rewards) based
in the interaction of the compound to certain targets \cite{YingkaiGao2018,
Zhavoronkov2019} or the combination of the compund with other drugs
\cite{Zitnik2018}---a common practice in patients with cancer.

All these possible changes on the critic model would apply at different abstraction
levels. That opens the door to seek for ways to integrate the representations learnt at
those different stages \cite{Ying2018, Ma2019, Huang2019}. On top of that information
extracted from here could be then leveraged on the drug generation part of the
framework.
